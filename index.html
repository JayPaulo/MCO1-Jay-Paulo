        <h2>Authobiography</h2>
        <p>My name is Jay B. Paulo, I was born on June 22, 2004. I have a 2 sisters and 2 brothers, My parents are Nenita
          Paulo and Gabriel Paulo. One of my sister is Graduate as Civil Engineer and my other siblings they didn’t finish
          college. My mother is a house wife while my father is a farmer.
           </p>
          <p>When I was a child, I really want to become adult because it seems like you’re happier when you’re older,
              but that’s what I don’t know. As you get older, you have more and more responsibilities in life, and life sinks
              deeper into sadness. When I was young, I should have enjoyed my childhood, not wanted to grow old although
              aging cannot be stopped. When I was child I always play with my friends even though I get scolded when I get
              home and also we going to the river to swim/bath. When I was high school I didn’t take my classes seriously
              and I was just chill and I met a lot friends but I really had one friend she was like sister to me and we went
              everywhere together but she transferred to another school but we were in grade 10 that time. When I was
              senior high school I took a strand called ABM and I passed it and now in college when you think what you did
              before, it’s like you’re laughing at it, but it’s like it’s fun to be a kid, not like now when you have so many
              thoughts like how you’re going to survive in college because they give so much activities.</p>

              <p>To the people who push me to who I am today are my friends, family, and to the people who didn’t believe
                  in me. They are the reason why I am working hard to finish my studies so that I can repay what they did for
                  me and the people who don’t believe in me, so that I can show them that I can do it.</p> <p></p>
